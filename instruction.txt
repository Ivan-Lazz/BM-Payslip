Notes: 
• The project as two parts, the frontend and the backend. 
• This will be deployed locally through XAMPP and host computer. 
• The UI design should have the primary color of #ff8c00, but don’t make it too 
dominant on the pages. 
• It should be able to create an initial user account when the database has no 
content (There is no need to display the initial account credentials, just include 
it in a manual for the project).
